# SpamBayes Outlook Add-in (Rust)

A native Rust implementation of the SpamBayes Outlook COM add-in. This is a ground-up rewrite of the original Python SpamBayes Outlook2000 plugin, compiled to a standalone 64-bit DLL that loads directly into Microsoft Outlook without requiring a Python runtime.

**Version:** 0.3.0-alpha.2

## Overview

SpamBayes uses a Bayesian statistical classifier to sort email into ham (good), spam, or unsure. This Rust version provides:

- **Native 64-bit COM add-in** — loads as an in-process DLL, no Python or runtime dependencies
- **Real-time folder monitoring** — watches configured folders via Outlook's `Items.ItemAdd` COM events
- **Timer-based batching** — configurable start delay + interval to batch rapid message arrivals
- **Automatic scoring and filtering** — classifies messages and moves them to configured spam/unsure folders
- **Bounce-back detection** — detects and re-moves pre-scored messages that return to watched folders
- **Calendar spam filtering** — detects meeting/appointment spam with Prompt/Trash/Move actions
- **Ribbon UI** — Spam, Not Spam, Show Clues, and Manager buttons in Outlook's ribbon
- **GTK4 Manager GUI** — standalone configuration and training interface (`spambayes_manager.exe`)
- **Show Clues viewer** — displays token evidence for a selected message's score (`spambayes_clues.exe`)
- **Notification sounds** — WAV playback with priority logic (Ham > Unsure > Spam)
- **Session and lifetime statistics** — counters persisted to JSON across restarts
- **Configuration wizard** — 6-page first-run setup for folder selection and thresholds
- **Training data export** — export to Ham/Spam bucket directories
- **Spam auto-cleanup** — delete old spam based on configurable retention period
- **Configuration migration** — reads existing Python SpamBayes INI files and classifier database
- **Zero-dependency installer** — InnoSetup-based, single-file setup

## Architecture

The project is organized as a Cargo workspace with five crates:

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable, latest) with the 64-bit MSVC target:
  ```
  rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  ```
- Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+ (MSVC linker + Windows SDK)
- MSYS2 with GTK4 dev libraries (ucrt64 — for Manager GUI)
- InnoSetup 6 (for installer, optional)

### Build Commands

```cmd
# From the Outlook365/ directory:

# Full pipeline: build DLL + Manager + Clues, deploy, bundle GTK4, build installer
build_all.bat

# Build without deploying to install directory
build_all.bat --no-deploy

# Build DLL only (no GUI features)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --lib

# Build Manager GUI + Clues viewer
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --bin spambayes_manager --bin spambayes_clues --features gui

# Run unit tests
cargo test --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Build installer (requires Inno Setup 6)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer\spambayes_outlook.iss
```

### Build Output

```
target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/spambayes_addin.dll     # COM DLL (loaded by Outlook)
target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/spambayes_manager.exe   # GTK4 Manager GUI
target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/spambayes_clues.exe     # Show Clues viewer
installer/output/SpamBayes_Outlook_Setup_0.3.0a2.exe           # Installer
```

### Key Dependencies

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `windows` | 0.58 | Win32 API bindings (COM, Registry, MAPI, UI) |
| `thiserror` | 1 | Error type derivation |
| `mailparse` | 0.15 | Email/MIME parsing for tokenizer |
| `memmap2` | 0.9 | Memory-mapped file I/O for storage |
| `indexmap` | 2 | Ordered hash maps for config |
| `gtk4` | 0.9 | GTK4 Rust bindings (Manager GUI, feature-gated) |
| `serde` + `serde_json` | 1 | JSON serialization for statistics |
| `ureq` | 2 | HTTP client for version checking |
| `crossbeam-channel` | 0.5 | Thread-safe message passing |

| `criterion` | 0.5 | Benchmarking (dev only) |

## Installation

### Via Installer (Recommended)

Run `SpamBayes_Outlook_Setup_*.exe` as Administrator. The installer will:
1. Install the DLL, Manager, and Clues viewer to `C:\Program Files\SpamBayes\`
2. Bundle GTK4 runtime DLLs alongside the executables
3. Register the COM add-in via `regsvr32` (64-bit)
4. Create Start Menu shortcuts for the Manager
5. Outlook will load SpamBayes on next startup

The installer requires 64-bit Outlook and Windows 10 or later.

### Manual Registration

```cmd
regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\SpamBayes\spambayes_addin.dll"
```

To unregister:
```cmd
regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files\SpamBayes\spambayes_addin.dll"
```

## Configuration

Configuration uses a layered INI system stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpamBayes\`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `global.ini` | Global settings (shared across profiles) |
| `default.ini` | Profile-specific settings |
| `spambayes.db` | Classifier token database |
| `spambayes_msg.db` | Per-message metadata |
| `spambayes_stats.json` | Lifetime statistics |
| `addin_debug.log` | Debug log |

The config chain applies settings in order: **defaults -> global.ini -> profile.ini** (sparse save — only non-default values are written).

### Key Settings

| Section | Key | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `[Filter]` | `enabled` | Enable/disable real-time filtering |
| `[Filter]` | `watch_folder_ids` | Folders to monitor for new messages |
| `[Filter]` | `spam_folder_id` | Destination for classified spam |
| `[Filter]` | `unsure_folder_id` | Destination for unsure messages |
| `[Filter]` | `spam_threshold` | Score at/above which = spam (default: 90%) |
| `[Filter]` | `unsure_threshold` | Score at/above which = unsure (default: 15%) |
| `[Filter]` | `timer_enabled` | Background timer-based filtering |
| `[Filter]` | `timer_start_delay` | Seconds before first timer fires |
| `[Filter]` | `timer_interval` | Seconds between timer ticks |
| `[General]` | `cleanup_enabled` | Auto-delete old spam |
| `[General]` | `cleanup_days` | Retention period for spam folder |
| `[Calendar]` | `calendar_action` | Action for calendar spam (Prompt/Trash/Move) |
| `[Notification]` | `sound_enabled` | Enable notification sounds |

The Manager GUI (launched from the ribbon or Start Menu) provides a visual interface for all settings.

## How It Works

### Startup Sequence

1. Outlook loads `spambayes_addin.dll` via COM (`DllGetClassObject` -> `IClassFactory` -> `AddinCore`)
2. `OnConnection` — stores Application pointer, initializes logger, MAPI session, loads config chain and classifier database
3. `OnStartupComplete` — defers UI and folder hook setup via Windows timers (avoids COM reentrancy)
4. Toolbar timer (1.5s) — creates CommandBar buttons via Outlook Object Model
5. Folder hook timer (2.5s) — resolves watch folders, connects `ItemAdd` event sinks
6. First-run detection — if no config file exists, launches the configuration wizard

### Message Processing Flow

```
New message arrives in watched folder
        |
        v
ItemAdd event fires on Items collection
        |
        v
Timer batching (start delay + interval processing)
        |
        v
Extract message content (MIME or Headers+Body via PropertyAccessor)
        |
        v
Tokenize (headers, body, HTML, URLs, skip-bigrams)
        |
        v
Score with Bayesian classifier (Robinson-method, chi-squared combining)
        |
        v
Classify: Score >= spam_threshold -> Spam
          Score >= unsure_threshold -> Unsure
          Otherwise -> Ham
        |
        v
Perform action: Move to spam/unsure folder, update statistics, play notification
```

### Bounce-Back Handling

When watching Exchange-managed folders like "Junk Email", Exchange may move messages back after SpamBayes moves them. The add-in detects these bounced messages by checking for existing score metadata and re-moves them to the correct destination without re-scoring.

### COM Registration

The DLL registers under:
- **CLSID**: `{A3B9E8D1-4F2C-4A6E-B8D7-1234567890AB}`
- **ProgID**: `SpamBayes.OutlookAddin`
- **Outlook Addins**: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\SpamBayes.OutlookAddin`
- **LoadBehavior**: 3 (load at startup)
- **Threading Model**: Apartment (STA)

## User Interface

### Ribbon Buttons
- **Spam** — mark selected message(s) as spam, train classifier, move to spam folder
- **Not Spam** — mark selected message(s) as ham, train classifier, move back to inbox
- **Show Clues** — launch Clues viewer showing token evidence for the selected message's score
- **Manager** — launch the GTK4 Manager GUI for configuration and training

### Context Menu
- Right-click any message for Spam/Not Spam options

### Manager GUI (spambayes_manager.exe)
- View session and lifetime statistics
- Configure thresholds, folders, and notification settings
- Browse MAPI folder tree for folder selection
- Trigger batch training from configured ham/spam folders
- View classifier database health (token counts, training totals)

## Logging

The add-in writes timestamped diagnostic logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpamBayes\`:

| Log File | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `addin_debug.log` | COM lifecycle, toolbar, timer events, configuration, errors |

Example log output:
```
[15:30:45] ========== ItemAdd FIRED in 'Junk Email' ==========
[15:30:45]   Subject: Win a free iPhone!!!
[15:30:45]   Sender: spammer@evil.com
[15:30:45]   MessageClass: IPM.Note
[15:30:45]   Content source: Headers (2048 bytes) + Body (512 bytes)
[15:30:45]   *** CLASSIFICATION: Spam ***
[15:30:45]   Score: 87.34%
[15:30:45]   Spam threshold: 18.90%, Unsure threshold: 13.40%
[15:30:45]   Action: MOVE to Spam folder (entry=0000000097D1...)
[15:30:45]   Processing COMPLETE for 'Win a free iPhone!!!'
```

## Security

- **Snyk SAST**: 0 issues found in Rust code
- **Static CRT linking**: No runtime DLL dependencies (self-contained binary)
- **Memory safety**: Rust ownership model prevents buffer overflows and use-after-free
- **COM safety**: Unsafe blocks are confined to COM vtable implementations with documented invariants
- **No network access**: The add-in processes email locally; no data is sent externally

## Migration from Python SpamBayes

The Rust add-in automatically detects and migrates from the Python version:
- **Configuration** — reads Python-format INI from `%APPDATA%\SpamBayes\`, converts to Rust format in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpamBayes\`
- **Classifier database** — imports token counts from existing Python pickle/dbm databases
- **Message database** — loads per-message classification history

## Compatibility

- **Outlook**: Microsoft 365, 2021, 2019, 2016 (64-bit only)
- **Windows**: 10, 11 (64-bit)
- **Account types**: Exchange, Outlook.com/Hotmail, IMAP

## Project Status

This is an active development project (alpha). Current stats:
- 5 workspace crates, 44 source files
- 400+ unit tests across all crates
- 53 implemented features (see `Outlook365/docs/RUST_ADDIN_STATS.md`)
